# Oh No! I'm Surrounded by LLMs! (LLMRiddles)

## Project Introduction
"Oh No! I'm Surrounded by LLMs!" is an intellectual challenge game. We use GPT4 to automatically generate corresponding game code based on Gradio application, combined with preset questions from the Zhihu article ["How to Accomplish Tasks with 'Impossible'"](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/665393240), creating a unique gameplay experience. 

In this game, players are required to cleverly construct questions that challenge the LLM to provide answers that meet specific conditions.
